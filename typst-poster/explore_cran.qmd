# CRAN collaboration network

The CRAN collaboration network consists of R package developers who are connected if they appear together as authors of an R package in the DESCRIPTION file. The data was crawled on September 5th 2023. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/schochastics/cran_collaboration).

![CRAN collaboration network (September 2023)](./images/collab_network.png){width="100%"}

The network consists of 15419 R developers and 126,988 collaborative ties.
Note that the graph only shows the *biggest component* of the network. 

# Six Degrees of Hadley Wickham

If you are familiar with the [Erdős
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) number and/or
the [Bacon
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers)
then you know where this is going. The “Hadley number” is defined as the
distance of R developers to Hadley Wickham in the collaboration graph.
Someone (“A”) who contributed to a package that Hadley has contributed
to has a Hadley number of 1. Someone who contributed to a package that A
has contributed to but not Hadley has Hadley number 2, and so on. Hadley
himself is the only person with Hadley number 0.
`````{=typst}
  ]
)
`````

The distribution of Hadley numbers is shown in @fig-hadley.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-hadley
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of the Hadley Number of R package developers"
df <- data.frame(dist = V(g)$dist2HW)

ggplot(df, aes(x = dist)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 7, color = "white", fill = "#477491") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    ) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10), name = "Hadley Number")

```

To get your own Hadley number, head to [GitHub](https://github.com/schochastics/cran_collaboration), download the network and run 
```r
library(igraph)
g <- readRDS("coauthor-biggest_comp.RDS")
me <- "David Schoch"
idx <- which(V(g)$name==me)
V(g)$dist2HW[idx]
```

# The center of the collaboration network

The center of the collaboration network is defined as the developer
who’s average distance to all other developers is the lowest. The top
ten developers in that regard are shown below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-center
#| tbl-cap: "Most central developers in the CRAN collaboration network"
df <- data.frame(Developer = V(g)$name, centrality = V(g)$cc / vcount(g))
df |>
    dplyr::top_n(10, -centrality) |>
    dplyr::arrange(centrality) |>
    knitr::kable()


```

# R package dependency network

The R package dependency network is based on the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION file.

![R package dependency network (based on Imports, September 2023)](./images/depend_network.png){width="100%"}

The dependency network consists of 16855 packages with 94267 imports. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-import
#| tbl-cap: "Most frequently imported R packages"

data.frame(package = V(d)$name, imported = degree(d, mode = "in")) |>
    dplyr::top_n(10, imported) |>
    arrange(desc(imported)) |>
    knitr::kable(row.names = FALSE)
